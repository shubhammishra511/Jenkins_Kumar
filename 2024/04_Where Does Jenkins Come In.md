##  2.1 Why Automate Builds?

---

###  **Life Before Build Tools (Maven, Gradle)**

####  Before (Manual Build Hell)

Let’s go back to a time before tools like Maven or Gradle were common…

* Developer writes code
* To compile the project:

  * Runs `javac` manually on each `.java` file
  * Handles classpath, dependencies, library JARs **manually**
* If app has 10 external libraries? Manually download each JAR.
* To package:

  * Zip files manually or use basic scripts
* To run tests:

  * Manually execute test classes with `java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore`

>  Pain Points:
>
> * Tedious and error-prone
> * Inconsistent builds
> * Difficult to onboard new developers
> * Time wasted managing build process instead of writing code

---

###  After (Maven / Gradle to the Rescue)

####  What Maven/Gradle Automate:

| Task                      | Manual Approach                | With Maven/Gradle             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **Compile code**          | Use `javac` manually           | `mvn compile`, `gradle build` |
| **Dependency management** | Download and add JARs manually | Auto-fetch from repositories  |
| **Testing**               | Run test cases manually        | `mvn test`, `gradle test`     |
| **Packaging**             | Zip/JAR manually               | `mvn package`, `gradle jar`   |
| **Reproducibility**       | Depends on dev’s machine       | Same result on any machine    |

####  Example:

With Maven:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>junit</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
    <version>4.12</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Just run:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

Everything — compile, test, package — happens **automatically**.

>  *Result: Developers focus on writing logic. Build tools take care of repeatable, predictable builds.*

---

###  So Where Does Jenkins Come In?

Even with Maven or Gradle, the **developer still has to**:

* Run the build commands manually
* Push artifacts manually
* Test and deploy manually
* Ensure builds happen consistently across environments

That’s where **Jenkins** enters the scene:

---

##  Jenkins: The Automation Orchestrator

> Think of Jenkins as the **automation conductor** that ties everything together.

#### What Jenkins Does:

* Automatically detects code changes (via Git push/PR)
* Runs your **Maven/Gradle commands** behind the scenes
* Executes your tests, builds, and packages
* Deploys artifacts to servers or cloud
* Sends notifications (email, Slack, etc.)

#### Example:

When a developer pushes code:

1. Jenkins checks out the code from Git
2. Executes `mvn clean install`
3. Runs unit tests
4. Packages the app into a `.jar`
5. Deploys it to a staging server
6. Sends success/failure notifications

###  Summary

| Layer         | Tool           | Responsibility                      |
| ------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Build logic   | Maven / Gradle | Define how to build, test, package  |
| Orchestration | Jenkins        | Automate when and how builds happen |

---

Absolutely, here’s a **language-wise list of popular build automation tools**, covering compilation, testing, packaging, and dependency management — all tailored to various programming languages.

##  Build Automation Tools by Programming Language

| Language                            | Build Automation Tools                           | Description                                                                                      |
