## Jenkins Tutorial Outline: From CI/CD Fundamentals to Build Automation

### **Part 1: CI/CD – The Foundation of Modern DevOps**

#### 1.1 What is CI/CD?

* Definition of Continuous Integration (CI)
* Definition of Continuous Delivery (CD)
* What is Continuous Deployment?

#### 1.2 Why CI/CD?

* Benefits: Faster releases, fewer bugs, better collaboration
* CI/CD vs Traditional Software Delivery
* DevOps and CI/CD synergy

#### 1.3 Real-World Use Cases

* Frequent deployment for a fintech app
* Automation in e-commerce pipelines
* Microservices with independent release cycles

#### 1.4 CI/CD Pipeline Components

* Code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)
* Build server (e.g., Jenkins)
* Artifact repository (e.g., Nexus, JFrog)
* Deployment (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker, cloud platforms)

### **Part 2: Introduction to Build Automation**

#### 2.1 Why Automate Builds?

* Manual build drawbacks
* Code consistency and reproducibility

#### 2.2 Key Concepts in Build Automation

* Build triggers (push events, PRs, schedules)
* Compilation, Testing, Packaging
* Artifact creation and storage

#### 2.3 Popular Build Automation Tools

* Jenkins
* GitHub Actions
* CircleCI, Travis CI
* Maven, Gradle (for Java projects)

### **Part 3: Jenkins – The CI/CD Engine**

#### 3.1 What is Jenkins?

* Jenkins Overview and History
* Features and Architecture
* Master-agent concept

#### 3.2 Installing Jenkins

* System Requirements
* Installing on:

  * Ubuntu/Linux
  * Docker
  * Windows
* First-time setup and UI tour

#### 3.3 Jenkins Basics

* Job types: Freestyle, Pipeline, Multibranch
* Configuring a Freestyle Job
* Using Git as a source code repo
* Running your first build

---

### **Part 4: Jenkins Pipelines – Going Pro**

#### 4.1 Understanding Jenkins Pipelines

* What is a Pipeline as Code?
* Declarative vs Scripted Pipelines
* Jenkinsfile explained

#### 4.2 Creating Your First Pipeline

* Writing and storing Jenkinsfile in Git
* Building, Testing, Deploying with stages
* Basic syntax: `pipeline`, `agent`, `stages`, `steps`

#### 4.3 Real Use Case: CI/CD for a Java Project

* Code checkout from GitHub
* Build with Maven
* Unit Test with JUnit
* Archive artifacts

---

### **Part 5: Advanced Jenkins Concepts**

#### 5.1 Integrating with Tools

* Docker
* SonarQube
* Nexus/JFrog
* Slack/MS Teams notifications

#### 5.2 Credentials and Secrets Management

* Using Jenkins credentials securely
* Integrating with secret managers (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

#### 5.3 Jenkins Plugins Ecosystem

* Must-have plugins (Pipeline, Git, BlueOcean, Email-ext)
* How to install and manage plugins

---

### **Part 6: Jenkins at Scale**

#### 6.1 Jenkins in Production

* Backup and restore
* Monitoring and alerting
* Security best practices

#### 6.2 Jenkins in a Team Environment

* Folder-based project organization
* Role-based access control
* Parallel and matrix builds

#### 6.3 Jenkins on Kubernetes (optional advanced topic)

* Why Jenkins on K8s?
* Helm chart deployment
* Jenkins agents as pods

---

### **Extras: Hands-on Labs and Templates**

* Sample Jenkinsfile templates
* Jenkins pipeline for Dockerized Node.js app
* Jenkins + GitHub + DockerHub CI/CD workflow
* Lab: Deploy to AWS EC2 or Kubernetes
