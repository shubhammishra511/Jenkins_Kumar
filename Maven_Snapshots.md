In **Maven**, a **SNAPSHOT** is a special version of a project that indicates it is still under active development and not yet finalized. SNAPSHOT versions are used when a project is still evolving, and changes may occur frequently. It is common practice to use SNAPSHOT versions during development and switch to release versions for stable and final builds.

### Key Features of SNAPSHOT
1. **Dynamic Updates**: 
   - Maven checks for updates to SNAPSHOT dependencies in the repository at regular intervals. If a newer version exists, it is downloaded and used in the build.

2. **Versioning**:
   - A SNAPSHOT version is denoted with a suffix, such as `1.0-SNAPSHOT`.

3. **Timestamped Builds**:
   - When a SNAPSHOT is deployed to a remote repository, it gets a timestamped version (e.g., `1.0-20241119.123456-1`), ensuring that every build is uniquely identifiable.

4. **Not Finalized**:
   - SNAPSHOT versions are considered unstable and are subject to change. They represent work-in-progress (WIP) and should not be used in production environments.

### How SNAPSHOT Works
When you specify a dependency in your `pom.xml` as a SNAPSHOT, Maven looks for the latest version of that dependency in both your local and remote repositories.

#### Example:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>my-library</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

- **Maven Workflow**:
  - **Local Repository Check**: Maven first checks if the latest SNAPSHOT is available locally.
  - **Remote Repository Check**: If not found or outdated, Maven downloads the latest SNAPSHOT from the remote repository.

### Differences Between SNAPSHOT and Release Versions
| Feature                | SNAPSHOT                         | Release Version             |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Stability**          | Unstable (work-in-progress)     | Stable and finalized        |
| **Updates**            | Can change frequently           | Does not change             |
| **Version Identifier** | `1.0-SNAPSHOT`                  | `1.0`, `2.0` (or similar)   |
| **Use Case**           | Development                     | Production                  |

### Use Cases
1. **Ongoing Development**:
   - When the team is actively working on a feature or module and frequent updates are expected.
2. **Continuous Integration**:
   - For builds and deployments in CI environments to test the latest code.

### Important Notes
- Avoid using SNAPSHOT versions in production systems because they can lead to inconsistencies due to frequent updates.
- Replace all SNAPSHOT versions with release versions before deploying the application to production.
